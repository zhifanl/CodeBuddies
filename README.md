## How to run it

* Clone our repository
* Download XAMPP
* run the Apache web server and MySQL database on XAMPP
* move the demo folder to the htdocs inside the XAMPP
* Now you can access the website via ``http:localhost/demo``
* If it does not work, make sure the port number is correct (you can find which port the server is using by finding it on XAMPP, mine is 80, someone's port is 8080), then try ``http:localhost:{{port}}/demo``
* To login as Admin, simply create a new user on your localhost with username: admin
